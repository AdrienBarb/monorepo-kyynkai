- Ensure each step has engaging dialogue and meaningful choices
- Balance free content with premium paid choices to encourage spending

### Fantasy Structure

#### Required Elements

```typescript
{
  "title": "[Short, enticing title]",
  "description": "[Brief 1-2 sentence description]",
  "steps": [
    {
      "order": 1,
      "text": "[Direct dialogue from AI girlfriend]",
      "mediaUrl": "[S3 key placeholder]",
      "choices": [
        {
          "label": "[Short choice text]",
          "cost": 0 // or number for premium choices
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Content Guidelines

#### Step Text Rules

- **Direct dialogue only** - No descriptive text since images show the scene
- **Short and engaging** - 1-2 sentences maximum
- **Question format** - Always end with a question or invitation for choice
- **Character voice** - Use appropriate pet names and personality
- **No quotes** - Write dialogue without surrounding quotes

#### Examples of Good Step Text:

- "Hey babe, do you want to enter?"
- "Where do you want me, honey? On the couch or straight to the bedroom?"
- "Baby, do you want me to remove my clothes?"
- "Ready for more, sweetheart? I want to make you feel amazing."

#### Examples of Bad Step Text:

- "Monica opens the door in sexy lingerie. 'Hey babe, do you want to enter?' She bites her lip seductively." (Too descriptive)
- "'Hey babe, do you want to enter?'" (Unnecessary quotes)
- "She stands there waiting for your response, her eyes filled with desire as she contemplates what might happen next." (Too long, no question)

### Choice Design

#### Choice Labels

- **Short and clear** - 2-4 words maximum
- **Action-oriented** - What the user wants to do
- **Varied options** - Different levels of intensity/approach

#### Examples of Good Choices:

- "Come inside" / "Kiss her first"
- "Couch first" / "Bedroom now"
- "Yes, slowly" / "Let me help"
- "Touch her" / "Keep undressing"

#### Examples of Bad Choices:

- "Tell her that you think she looks absolutely beautiful and that you've been thinking about this moment all day" (Too long)
- "Maybe" / "I don't know" (Not engaging)
- "Choice A" / "Choice B" (Not descriptive)

### Pricing Strategy

#### Free Steps (Build Story & Engagement)

- **Steps 1-2**: Always free to hook users into the story
- **Basic progression**: Free choices that advance the narrative
- **Story building**: Non-sexual interactions should be free

#### Paid Steps (Premium Content)

- **Sexual content**: Choices involving nudity, touching, or sexual acts
- **Enhanced options**: More intense or dominant choices
- **Escalating costs**: 1 → 2 → 3 credits as intensity increases

#### Pricing Examples:

```
Step 1: Door/Entry - FREE
Step 2: Location choice - FREE
Step 3: Undressing - 1-2 credits
Step 4: Touching - 2-3 credits
Step 5: Foreplay - 3-4 credits
Step 6: Climax - 3-5 credits
```

### Scenario Progression

#### 6-Step Template

1. **Initial Contact** (FREE)

   - Door, phone call, surprise encounter
   - Build anticipation and set scene

2. **Location/Setup** (FREE)

   - Where to go, what to do first
   - Continue building tension

3. **First Escalation** (1-2 credits)

   - Clothing removal, kissing, touching
   - First sexual element introduced

4. **Intimacy Building** (2-3 credits)

   - More touching, partial nudity
   - Increased sexual tension

5. **Foreplay** (3-4 credits)

   - Direct sexual contact
   - High arousal content

6. **Climax** (3-5 credits)
   - Final sexual act
   - Story conclusion

### Character Consistency

#### Voice and Personality

- Use character's established pet names consistently
- Match archetype (stepmom, neighbor, teacher, etc.)
- Maintain seductive but appropriate tone for character

#### Pet Names by Archetype:

- **Stepmom**: "sweetheart", "baby", "honey", "darling"
- **Neighbor**: "handsome", "cutie", "neighbor boy"
- **Teacher**: "student", "dear", "good boy"
- **Boss**: "employee", "good boy", "pet"

### Technical Requirements

#### Media Integration

- Each step should have a mediaUrl placeholder
- Images show the scene, text provides dialogue
- No need to describe what's visible in the image

#### Step Connections

- All choices in steps 1-5 should lead to the next step
- Final step choices end the fantasy (nextStepId: null)
- Ensure proper progression flow

### Scenario Ideas

#### Popular Themes

- **Late night visit** - Door encounter leading to bedroom
- **Caught in the act** - Surprise encounter, escalating tension
- **Study session** - Teacher/student roleplay with progression
- **Work overtime** - Boss/employee after-hours encounter
- **Neighbor help** - Innocent request becoming intimate
- **Massage therapy** - Professional service becoming personal

#### Setting Variations

- Home (kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, living room)
- Office (after hours, private meeting)
- Public spaces (car, hotel, changing room)
- Outdoor (pool, garden, balcony)

### Best Practices

1. **Start innocent** - Build tension gradually
2. **Free hook** - First 2 steps should be free to engage users
3. **Clear progression** - Each step should feel like natural escalation
4. **Character voice** - Maintain consistent personality and speech patterns
5. **Visual synergy** - Text complements images, doesn't repeat them
6. **Choice variety** - Offer different approaches (gentle vs aggressive, slow vs fast)
7. **Pricing psychology** - Make users invest gradually, not all at once
8. **Satisfying conclusion** - Final step should feel worth the journey
